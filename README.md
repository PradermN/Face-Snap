Snapface is an application where users have the option to like(snap) or dislike(unsnap) photos.

The application has been programmed so that the components can be as independent as possible from each other to facilitate dynamism and interaction with the page.

When a photo is liked, its background changes color and turns green, but also obviously the number of likes increases and it is possible to dislike afterwards.

I wish you pleasure looking at the photos taken with care for you!  :)
